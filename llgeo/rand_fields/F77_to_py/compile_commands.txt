~ It's a good idea to google the "smart" way of compiling with F2PY
  It involves first creating a signature file ".pyf" that provides instructions
  on how to port the Fortran arguments and outputs to python. Then,
  a second command to compile everything together.

~ The commands needed here are the following (entered in Linux terminal, in same directory as files to be compiled):
   0) rm *.so *.pyf (the signature file creation will fail if a file exists. Deleting the .so file doesn't really matter, but I like doing it).
   1) python3 -m numpy.f2py sim1d.f sim2d.f -m simLAS -h simLAS.pyf
   2) python3 -m numpy.f2py -lGAF77 -c simLAS.pyf sim1d.f sim2d.f --fcompiler=gnu

NOTE: this should be incredibly easy to automate using a terminal script thingy but there is too much to do in too little time...
 	problem for another day.
